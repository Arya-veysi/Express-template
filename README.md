## Configuration

App configuration files are located in the `src/config` directory. This includes environment-specific settings, database configuration, and app-level settings.

---

## API Documentation

The project uses [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation. You can find the Swagger YAML file in:

```
src/docs/swagger.yaml
```

To view the documentation in a browser, integrate Swagger UI or use an online Swagger editor.

---

## Testing

Tests are located in the `src/tests` directory and use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Node.js and npm are correctly installed.
- Check `.env` variables if the app fails to start.
- Validate configuration in `src/config`.
